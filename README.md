# ðŸŒ± Carbon Footprint Calculator

This web application calculates your carbon footprint based on various lifestyle choices, including diet, driving habits, housing, electricity usage, and more. By answering a few simple questions, you can get an estimate of your annual carbon emissions (in kilograms of COâ‚‚).

## Features

- **Diet**: Choose from options like meat, vegetarian, vegan, or a mixed diet to calculate its environmental impact.
- **Driving Distance**: Select how far you typically drive each year to calculate the carbon emissions from your vehicle.
- **Fuel Type**: Choose your vehicleâ€™s fuel type (gasoline, diesel, gas, or electric) to estimate its emissions.
- **Flying**: Choose the frequency of your flights, if applicable.
- **Housing**: Select the type of housing you live in (apartment, townhouse, house, maisonette).
- **Electricity Usage**: Specify your annual electricity consumption in kWh to calculate the impact based on energy usage.

## How It Works

The calculator uses predefined carbon emission factors for different lifestyle choices:

- **Diet**: Different diets (meat, vegetarian, vegan, mixed) have varying levels of carbon emissions, based on average global data.
- **Driving Distance**: The carbon emissions from driving are calculated based on the number of kilometers you drive each year.
- **Fuel Type**: Different vehicle fuel types have different carbon emission factors.
- **Flying**: The more you fly, the higher your carbon footprint will be.
- **Housing**: Different housing types have different associated emissions based on their size, energy efficiency, and construction materials.
- **Electricity**: The emissions are based on your electricity consumption, depending on the energy mix in your region.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for the development environment.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app with a clean, modern look.
